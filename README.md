# Data_Salary

Welcome to the **Data Science Salary Analysis** project. This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of salary trends in the data science field. The analysis is based on a CSV dataset and is supported by detailed data exploration and visualization notebooks.

## üìä Project Overview

This project aims to provide insights into the salary distribution, geographic trends, and career growth potential for data science professionals. The analysis includes:

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial examination of the dataset to understand its structure, characteristics, and potential relationships between variables.
2. **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of key findings to illustrate salary trends and comparisons across various dimensions.

The project is divided into the following key files:

### üóÇÔ∏è Files in the Repository

- **`ds_salaries.csv`**: The raw dataset containing information on job titles, salary, location, and other relevant attributes for data science roles.
- **`Data_exploration.ipynb`**: The notebook containing code for the initial data exploration, including data cleaning, summary statistics, and feature extraction.
- **`Data_exploration_grafic.ipynb`**: The notebook focused on visualizations that highlight salary distributions, regional comparisons, and career growth potential.

## üìå Introduction

The data science industry is growing rapidly, and understanding salary trends is crucial for professionals and organizations alike. This project uses real-world data to analyze and visualize various factors affecting salaries in the data science domain. The goal is to help data science professionals make informed career decisions and aid companies in shaping their compensation strategies.

## üìä Data Overview

The dataset, `ds_salaries.csv`, includes the following columns:

- `work_year`: The year the salary was recorded.
- `experience_level`: The experience level in the job during the year.
- `employment_type`: The type of employment (e.g., Full-time, Part-time).
- `job_title`: The role or title of the job.
- `salary`: The raw salary amount.
- `salary_currency`: The currency of the salary.
- `employee_residence`: The primary residence of the employee.
- `remote_ratio`: The proportion of the job that is remote.
- `company_location`: The location of the company.
- `company_size`: The size of the company based on the number of employees.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning and Preparation

The `Data_exploration.ipynb` notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Analyzing the extent and impact of missing values in the dataset.
2. **Data Transformation**: Converting salary figures to a uniform currency (USD) to allow for meaningful comparisons.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features such as `salary_in_usd` and categorizing experience levels for further analysis.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA notebook dives into various aspects of the dataset, exploring relationships between variables and identifying key patterns. Key analysis includes:

- **Salary Distribution**: Examining how salaries vary across different job titles, experience levels, and geographic regions.
- **Experience Level Impact**: Analyzing how experience level influences salary and career progression.
- **Geographic Analysis**: Exploring salary variations across different countries and regions, with a focus on remote work trends.

## üìà Visualizations

The `Data_exploration_grafic.ipynb` notebook presents a series of visualizations to communicate the insights effectively. Key visualizations include:

- **Salary Distribution by Job Title**: A boxplot showing the salary range for each job title.
- **Experience Level vs. Salary**: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between experience level and salary.
- **Regional Salary Comparisons**: A choropleth map visualizing salary variations across different countries.

## üìä Key Insights and Findings

1. **Remote Work Influence**: Jobs with a higher remote ratio tend to offer higher salaries, indicating a premium for remote work flexibility.
2. **Experience Level Matters**: Senior-level roles (e.g., Principal, Lead) show a significantly higher salary range compared to entry-level roles.
3. **Regional Disparities**: Salaries vary widely across regions, with North America showing the highest average salaries, followed by Europe and Asia.

## üöÄ Future Work and Improvements

Some potential areas for future exploration include:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing salary trends over multiple years to identify growth patterns.
- **Job Title Normalization**: Grouping similar job titles to provide a clearer picture of career progression.
- **Additional Features**: Incorporating external data such as cost of living indices to contextualize salaries.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project provides a detailed analysis of data science salaries, offering valuable insights for professionals and companies in the field. The findings highlight the impact of experience level, job title, and geographic location on salaries, providing a comprehensive view of the data science job market.
